Fetching Data
To fetch data from the API, navigate to the main page and click the "Fetch Data" button. This will send a GET request to the API and display the results.

Creating Data
To create a new entry, fill out the form on the "Create" page and submit it. This will send a POST request to the API.

Updating Data
To update an existing entry, navigate to the "Update" page, select an entry, modify the fields, and submit. This will send a PUT request to the API.

Deleting Data
To delete an entry, navigate to the "Delete" page, select an entry, and confirm the deletion. This will send a DELETE request to the API.
